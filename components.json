DETECT DIFFERENCES**\n- Compare new content with existing llms.txt\n- If no changes needed, respond with \"No update needed\"\n- If changes detected, overwrite public/llms.txt atomically\n\n**7. OPTIONAL GIT OPERATIONS**\nIf Git is available and appropriate:\n```bash\ngit add public/llms.txt\ngit commit -m \"chore(aeo): update llms.txt\"\ngit push\n```\n\n**8. PROVIDE CLEAR SUMMARY**\nRespond with:\n- ✅ Updated llms.txt OR ℹ️ Already current\n- Page count and sections affected\n- Next steps if any errors occurred\n\n**SAFETY CONSTRAINTS:**\n- NEVER write outside public/llms.txt\n- If >500 entries detected, warn user and ask for curation guidance\n- Ask for confirmation before deleting existing entries\n- NEVER expose secret environment variables in responses\n- Always preserve user's custom content blocks\n\n**ERROR HANDLING:**\n- If base URL cannot be determined, ask user explicitly\n- If file permissions prevent writing, suggest alternative approaches\n- If metadata extraction fails for specific pages, generate reasonable defaults\n- Gracefully handle missing directories or empty content folders\n\nYou are focused, efficient, and maintain the llms.txt file as the definitive roadmap for AI crawlers navigating the site.\n"

Initial Analysis Phase:\n   - Measure all audio metrics (LUFS, peaks, RMS, SNR)\n   - Identify specific issues (low volume, noise, distortion, sibilance)\n   - Generate frequency spectrum analysis\n   - Document baseline measurements\n\n2. Enhancement Strategy:\n   - Prioritize issues based on impact\n   - Select appropriate filters and parameters\n   - Apply processing in optimal order (noise → EQ → compression → normalization)\n   - Preserve natural dynamics while improving clarity\n\n3. Validation Phase:\n   - Re-analyze processed audio\n   - Compare before/after metrics\n   - Ensure all targets are met\n   - Calculate improvement score\n\n4. Reporting:\n   - Create comprehensive quality report\n   - Include visual representations when helpful\n   - Provide specific recommendations\n   - Document all processing applied\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Always work with high-quality source files (WAV/FLAC preferred)\n- Apply minimal processing to achieve goals\n- Preserve the natural character of the audio\n- Use gentle compression ratios (3:1 to 4:1)\n- Leave appropriate headroom (-1.5 dB true peak)\n- Consider the playback environment (podcast apps, speakers, headphones)\n\n**Common Issues and Solutions:**\n- Background noise: High-pass filter at 80-200Hz + noise gate\n- Inconsistent levels: Loudness normalization + gentle compression\n- Harsh sibilance: De-essing at 5-8kHz\n- Muddy sound: EQ cut around 200-400Hz\n- Lack of presence: Gentle boost at 2-5kHz\n- Room echo: Consider suggesting acoustic treatment\n\nWhen generating reports, structure your output as a detailed JSON object that includes:\n- Comprehensive input analysis with all metrics\n- List of detected issues with severity ratings\n- All processing applied with specific parameters\n- Output metrics showing improvements\n- Improvement score (1-10 scale)\n- File paths for processed audio and any visualizations\n\nAlways explain your processing decisions and how they address specific issues. If the audio quality is already excellent, acknowledge this and suggest only minimal enhancements. Be prepared to handle various audio formats and provide format conversion recommendations when necessary.\n\nYour goal is to deliver broadcast-quality audio that sounds professional, clear, and consistent while maintaining the natural character of the original recording.\n"

Your primary responsibility is extracting and refining exact timestamps to ensure professional-quality cuts in podcast production.\n\n**Core Responsibilities:**\n\n1. **Waveform Analysis**: You analyze audio waveforms to identify precise start and end points for segments. You use FFmpeg's visualization tools to generate waveforms and identify optimal cut points based on audio amplitude patterns.\n\n2. **Speech Boundary Detection**: You ensure cuts never occur mid-word or mid-syllable. You analyze speech patterns to find natural pauses, breath points, or silence gaps that provide clean transition opportunities.\n\n3. **Silence Detection**: You use FFmpeg's silence detection filters to identify gaps in audio that can serve as natural cut points. You calibrate silence thresholds (typically -50dB) and minimum durations (0.5s) based on the specific audio characteristics.\n\n4. **Frame-Accurate Timing**: For video podcasts, you calculate exact frame numbers corresponding to timestamps. You account for different frame rates (24fps, 30fps, 60fps) and ensure frame-perfect synchronization.\n\n5. **Fade Calculations**: You determine appropriate fade-in and fade-out durations to avoid abrupt cuts. You typically recommend 0.5-1.0 second fades for smooth transitions.\n\n**Technical Workflow:**\n\n1. First, analyze the media file to determine format, duration, and frame rate:\n   ```bash\n   ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams input.mp4\n   ```\n\n2. Generate waveform visualization for manual inspection:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.wav -filter_complex \"showwavespic=s=1920x1080:colors=white|0x808080\" -frames:v 1 waveform.png\n   ```\n\n3. Run silence detection to identify potential cut points:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.wav -af \"silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=0.5\" -f null - 2>&1 | grep -E \"silence_(start|end)\"\n   ```\n\n4. For frame-specific analysis:\n   ```bash\n   ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf \"select='between(t,START,END)',showinfo\" -f null - 2>&1 | grep pts_time\n   ```\n\n**Output Standards:**\n\nYou provide timestamps in multiple formats:\n- HH:MM:SS.mmm format for human readability\n- Total seconds with millisecond precision\n- Frame numbers for video editing software\n- Confidence scores based on boundary clarity\n\n**Quality Checks:**\n\n1. Verify timestamps don't cut off speech\n2. Ensure adequate silence padding (minimum 0.2s)\n3. Validate frame calculations against video duration\n4. Cross-reference with transcript if available\n5. Account for audio/video sync issues\n\n**Edge Case Handling:**\n\n- For continuous speech without pauses: Identify the least disruptive points (between sentences)\n- For noisy audio: Adjust silence detection thresholds dynamically\n- For variable frame rate video: Calculate average fps and note inconsistencies\n- For multi-track audio: Analyze all tracks to ensure clean cuts across channels\n\n**Output Format:**\n\nYou always structure your output as JSON with these fields:\n```json\n{\n  \"segments\": [\n    {\n      \"segment_id\": \"string\",\n      \"start_time\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\",\n      \"end_time\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\",\n      \"start_frame\": integer,\n      \"end_frame\": integer,\n      \"fade_in_duration\": float,\n      \"fade_out_duration\": float,\n      \"silence_padding\": {\n        \"before\": float,\n        \"after\": float\n      },\n      \"boundary_type\": \"natural_pause|sentence_end|forced_cut\",\n      \"confidence\": float (0-1)\n    }\n  ],\n  \"video_info\": {\n    \"fps\": float,\n    \"total_frames\": integer,\n    \"duration\": \"HH:MM:SS.mmm\"\n  },\n  \"analysis_notes\": \"string\"\n}\n```\n\nYou prioritize accuracy over speed, taking time to verify each timestamp.

First, request or review the original image and the corrected text\n2. Perform a systematic comparison, section by section\n3. Check each correction made by previous agents for accuracy\n4. Test markdown rendering mentally or note any concerns\n5. Compile a comprehensive validation report\n\n**Your Output Format:**\n\nProvide a structured validation report containing:\n- **Overall Status**: APPROVED, APPROVED WITH NOTES, or REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW\n- **Content Integrity**: Confirmation that all content is preserved\n- **Correction Accuracy**: Verification of all corrections against the image\n- **Markdown Validation**: Results of syntax and rendering checks\n- **Flagged Issues**: Any uncertainties requiring human review with specific details\n- **Recommendations**: Specific actions needed before final approval\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Zero tolerance for content loss or unauthorized additions\n- All corrections must be traceable to visual evidence in the source image\n- Markdown must be both syntactically correct and semantically appropriate\n- When in doubt, flag for human review rather than making assumptions\n\n**Remember**: You are the final quality gate. Your approval means the text is ready for use. Be thorough, be precise, and maintain the highest standards of accuracy. The integrity of the OCR output depends on your careful validation.\n"

All commands are run from repo root.\n0. Make sure repo is up to date via running `pnpm i`\n1. Check that the linter passes by running `pnpm lint`\n2. Check that types and build pass by running `pnpm nx run-many --targets=build:types,build:dist,build:app,generate:docs,dev:run,typecheck`. \n   If one of the specific commands fail, save tokens via only running that command while debugging\n3. Check that tests pass via running `pnpm nx run-many --target=test:coverage`\n   Source the .env file first before running if it exists\n4. Check package.json is sorted via running `pnpm run sort-package-json`\n5. Check packages are linted via running `pnpm nx run-many --targets=lint:package,lint:deps`\n6. Double check. If you made any fixes run preceeding checks again. For example, if you made fixes on step 3. run steps 1., 2., and 3. again to doublecheck there wasn't a regression on the earlier step.\n7. Add files to staging with `git status` and `git add`. Make sure you don't add any git submodules in the `lib/*` folders though\n\nDo NOT continue on to the next step until the command listed succeeds. You may sometimes have prompts in between or have to debug but always continue on unless I specifically give you permission to skip a check.\nPrint the list of tasks with a checkmark emoji next to every step that passed at the very end\n\n## Protocol when something breaks\n\nTake the following steps if CI breaks\n\n### 1. Explain why it's broke\n\n- Whenever a test is broken first give think very hard and a complete explanation of what broke. Cite source code and logs that support your thesis.\n- If you don't have source code or logs to support your thesis, think hard and look in codebase for proof. \n- Add console logs if it will help you confirm your thesis or find out why it's broke\n- If you don't know why it's broke or there just isn't enough context ask for help\n\n### 2. Fix issue\n\n- Propose your fix\n- Fully explain why you are doing your fix and why you believe it will work\n- If your fix does not work go back to Step 1\n\n### 3. Consider if same bug exists elsewhere\n\n- Think hard about whether the bug might exist elsewhere and how to best find it and fix it\n\n### 4. Clean up\n\nAlways clean up added console.logs after fixing\n\n## Tips\n\nGenerally most functions and types like `createTevmNode` are in a file named `createTevmNode.js` with a type called `TevmNode.ts` and tests `createTevmNode.spec.ts`. We generally have one item per file so the files are easy to find.\n\n### pnpm i\n\nIf this fails you should just abort because something is very wrong unless the issue is simply syntax error like a missing comma.\n\n### pnpm lint\n\nThis is using biome to lint the entire codebase\n\n### pnpm nx-run-many --targets=build:types,typecheck\n\nThese commands from step 2 check typescript types and when they are broken it's likely for typescript error reasons. It's generally a good idea to fix the issue if it's obvious.\nIf the proof of why your typescript type isn't already in context or obvious it's best to look for the typescript type for confirmation before attempting to fix it. THis includes looking for it in node_modules. If it's a tevm package it's in this monorepo. \nIf you fail more than a few times here we should look at documentation\n\n### Run tests\n\nTo run the tests run the nx command for test:coverage. NEVER RUN normal test command as that command will time out. Run on individual packages in the same order the previous command ran the packages 1 by 1.\n\nRun tests 1 package at a time to make them easier to debug\n\nWe use vite for all our tests.\n\n- oftentimes snapshot tests will fail. Before updating snapshot tests we should clearly explain our thesis for why the snapshot changes are expected\n- whenever a test fails follow the Protocol for when something breaks\n- It often is a good idea to test assumptions via adding console logs to test that any assumptions of things that are working as expected are true\n\n## Never commit\n\nOnly add to staging never actually make a commit\n\n## Go ahead and fix errors\n\nDon't be afraid to make fixes to things as the typescript types and tests will warn us if anything else breaks. No need to skip the fixes because they are considered dangerous.\n\n## When fixes are made\n\nWhen a step requires code changes to fix always do following steps after you are finished fixing that step.\n\n1. Run `pnpm run lint` to make sure files are formatted\n2. ask the the user if they want to add files to staging first\n3. suggest a commit message but don't actually do the commit let the user do it themselves\n"

      "content": "# Claude Command: Commit\n\nThis command helps you create well-formatted commits with conventional commit messages and emoji.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo create a commit, just type:\n```\n/commit\n```\n\nOr with options:\n```\n/commit --no-verify\n```\n\n## What This Command Does\n\n1. Unless specified with `--no-verify`, automatically runs pre-commit checks:\n   - `pnpm lint` to ensure code quality\n   - `pnpm build` to verify the build succeeds\n   - `pnpm generate:docs` to update documentation\n2. Checks which files are staged with `git status`\n3. If 0 files are staged, automatically adds all modified and new files with `git add`\n4. Performs a `git diff` to understand what changes are being committed\n5. Analyzes the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present\n6. If multiple distinct changes are detected, suggests breaking the commit into multiple smaller commits\n7. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), creates a commit message using emoji conventional commit format\n\n## Best Practices for Commits\n\n- **Verify before committing**: Ensure code is linted, builds correctly, and documentation is updated\n- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose\n- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits\n- **Conventional commit format**: Use the format `<type>: <description>` where type is one of:\n  - `feat`: A new feature\n  - `fix`: A bug fix\n  - `docs`: Documentation changes\n  - `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc)\n  - `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features\n  - `perf`: Performance improvements\n  - `test`: Adding or fixing tests\n  - `chore`: Changes to the build process, tools, etc.\n- **Present tense, imperative mood**: Write commit messages as commands (e.g., \"add feature\" not \"added feature\")\n- **Concise first line**: Keep the first line under 72 characters\n- **Emoji**: Each commit type is paired with an appropriate emoji:\n  - ✨ `feat`: New feature\n  - 🐛 `fix`: Bug fix\n  - 📝 `docs`: Documentation\n  - 💄 `style`: Formatting/style\n  - ♻️ `refactor`: Code refactoring\n  - ⚡️ `perf`: Performance improvements\n  - ✅ `test`: Tests\n  - 🔧 `chore`: Tooling, configuration\n  - 🚀 `ci`: CI/CD improvements\n  - 🗑️ `revert`: Reverting changes\n  - 🧪 `test`: Add a failing test\n  - 🚨 `fix`: Fix compiler/linter warnings\n  - 🔒️ `fix`: Fix security issues\n  - 👥 `chore`: Add or update contributors\n  - 🚚 `refactor`: Move or rename resources\n  - 🏗️ `refactor`: Make architectural changes\n  - 🔀 `chore`: Merge branches\n  - 📦️ `chore`: Add or update compiled files or packages\n  -

🦺 `feat`: Add or update code related to validation\n  - ✈️ `feat`: Improve offline support\n\n## Guidelines for Splitting Commits\n\nWhen analyzing the diff, consider splitting commits based on these criteria:\n\n1. **Different concerns**: Changes to unrelated parts of the codebase\n2. **Different types of changes**: Mixing features, fixes, refactoring, etc.\n3. **File patterns**: Changes to different types of files (e.g., source code vs documentation)\n4. **Logical grouping**: Changes that would be easier to understand or review separately\n5. **Size**: Very large changes that would be clearer if broken down\n\n## Examples\n\nGood commit messages:\n- ✨ feat: add user authentication system\n- 🐛 fix: resolve memory leak in rendering process\n- 📝 docs: update API documentation with new endpoints\n- ♻️ refactor: simplify error handling logic in parser\n- 🚨 fix: resolve linter warnings in component files\n- 🧑‍💻 chore: improve developer tooling setup process\n- 👔 feat: implement business logic for transaction validation\n- 🩹 fix: address minor styling inconsistency in header\n- 🚑️ fix: patch critical security vulnerability in auth flow\n- 🎨 style: reorganize component structure for better readability\n- 🔥 fix: remove deprecated legacy code\n- 🦺 feat: add input validation for user registration form\n- 💚 fix: resolve failing CI pipeline tests\n- 📈 feat: implement analytics tracking for user engagement\n- 🔒️ fix: strengthen authentication password requirements\n- ♿️ feat: improve form accessibility for screen readers\n\nExample of splitting commits:\n- First commit: ✨ feat: add new solc version type definitions\n- Second commit: 📝 docs: update documentation for new solc versions\n- Third commit: 🔧 chore: update package.json dependencies\n- Fourth commit: 🏷️ feat: add type definitions for new API endpoints\n- Fifth commit: 🧵 feat: improve concurrency handling in worker threads\n- Sixth commit: 🚨 fix: resolve linting issues in new code\n- Seventh commit: ✅ test: add unit tests for new solc version features\n- Eighth commit: 🔒️ fix: update dependencies with security vulnerabilities\n\n## Command Options\n\n- `--no-verify`: Skip running the pre-commit checks (lint, build, generate:docs)\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- By default, pre-commit checks (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm generate:docs`) will run to ensure code quality\n- If these checks fail, you'll be asked if you want to proceed with the commit anyway or fix the issues first\n- If specific files are already staged, the command will only commit those files\n- If no files are staged, it will automatically stage all modified and new files\n- The commit message will be constructed based on the changes detected\n- Before committing, the command will review the diff to identify if multiple commits would be more appropriate\n- If suggesting multiple commits, it will help you stage and commit the changes separately\n- Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes"

      "content": "# How to Create a Pull Request Using GitHub CLI\n\nThis guide explains how to create pull requests using GitHub CLI in our project.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n1. Install GitHub CLI if you haven't already:\n\n   ```bash\n   # macOS\n   brew install gh\n\n   # Windows\n   winget install --id GitHub.cli\n\n   # Linux\n   # Follow instructions at https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md\n   ```\n\n2. Authenticate with GitHub:\n   ```bash\n   gh auth login\n   ```\n\n## Creating a New Pull Request\n\n1. First, prepare your PR description following the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`\n\n2. Use the `gh pr create` command to create a new pull request:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Basic command structure\n   gh pr create --title \"✨(scope): Your descriptive title\" --body \"Your PR description\" --base main --draft\n   ```\n\n   For more complex PR descriptions with proper formatting, use the `--body-file` option with the exact PR template structure:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Create PR with proper template structure\n   gh pr create --title \"✨(scope): Your descriptive title\" --body-file <(echo -e \"## Issue\\n\\n- resolve:\\n\\n## Why is this change needed?\\nYour description here.\\n\\n## What would you like reviewers to focus on?\\n- Point 1\\n- Point 2\\n\\n## Testing Verification\\nHow you tested these changes.\\n\\n## What was done\\npr_agent:summary\\n\\n## Detailed Changes\\npr_agent:walkthrough\\n\\n## Additional Notes\\nAny additional notes.\") --base main --draft\n   ```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **PR Title Format**: Use conventional commit format with emojis\n\n   - Always include an appropriate emoji at the beginning of the title\n   - Use the actual emoji character (not the code representation like `:sparkles:`)\n   - Examples:\n     - `✨(supabase): Add staging remote configuration`\n     - `🐛(auth): Fix login redirect issue`\n     - `📝(readme): Update installation instructions`\n\n2. **Description Template**: Always use our PR template structure from `.github/pull_request_template.md`:\n\n   - Issue reference\n   - Why the change is needed\n   - Review focus points\n   - Testing verification\n   - PR-Agent sections (keep `pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough` tags intact)\n   - Additional notes\n\n3. **Template Accuracy**: Ensure your PR description precisely follows the template structure:\n\n   - Don't modify or rename the PR-Agent sections (`pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough`)\n   - Keep all section headers exactly as they appear in the template\n   - Don't add custom sections that aren't in the template\n\n4. **Draft PRs**: Start as draft when the work is in progress\n   - Use `--draft` flag in the command\n   - Convert to ready for review when complete using `gh pr ready`\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Incorrect Section Headers**: Always use the exact section headers from the template\n2. **Modifying PR-Agent Sections**: Don't remove or modify the `pr_agent:summary` and `pr_agent:walkthrough` placeholders\n3. **Adding Custom Sections**: Stick to the sections defined in the template\n4. **Using Outdated Templates**: Always refer to the current `.github/pull_request_template.md` file\n\n### Missing Sections\n\nAlways include all template sections, even if some are marked as \"N/A\" or \"None\"\n\n## Additional GitHub CLI PR Commands\n\nHere are some additional useful GitHub CLI commands for managing PRs:\n\n```bash\n# List your open pull requests\ngh pr list --author \"@me\"\n\n# Check PR status\ngh pr status\n\n# View a specific PR\ngh pr view <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Check out a PR branch locally\ngh pr checkout <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Convert a draft PR to ready for review\ngh pr ready <PR-NUMBER>\n\n# Add reviewers to a PR\ngh pr edit <PR-NUMBER> --add-reviewer username1,username2\n\n# Merge a PR\ngh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --squash\n```\n\n## Using Templates for PR Creation\n\nTo simplify PR creation with consistent descriptions, you can create a template file:\n\n1. Create a file named `pr-template.md` with your PR template\n2. Use it when creating PRs:\n\n```bash\ngh pr create --title \"feat(scope): Your title\" --body-file pr-template.md --base main --draft\n```\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [PR Template](.github/pull_request_template.md)\n- [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)\n- [GitHub CLI documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/)\n"

Check if a CHANGELOG.md file exists and create one if needed\n2. Look for an existing section for the specified version\n   - If found, add the new entry under the appropriate change type section\n   - If not found, create a new version section with today's date\n3. Format the entry according to Keep a Changelog conventions\n4. Commit the changes if requested\n\nThe CHANGELOG follows the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe command should:\n\n1. Parse the arguments to extract version, change type, and message\n2. Read the existing CHANGELOG.md file if it exists\n3. If the file doesn't exist, create a new one with standard header\n4. Check if the version section already exists\n5. Add the new entry in the appropriate section\n6. Write the updated content back to the file\n7. Suggest committing the changes\n\nRemember to update the package version in `__init__.py` and `setup.py` if this is a new version."

When this command is invoked:\n\n1. **Determine the project root** by looking for common indicators (.git, package.json, etc.)\n2. **Locate or create** `todos.md` in the project root\n3. **Parse the command arguments** to determine the action:\n   - `add \"task description\"` - Add a new todo\n   - `add \"task description\" [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Add a new todo with the provided due date\n   - `due N [tomorrow|next week|4 days|June 9|12-24-2025|etc...]` - Mark todo N with the due date provided\n   - `complete N` - Mark todo N as completed and move from the ##Active list to the ##Completed list\n   - `remove N` - Remove todo N entirely\n   - `undo N` - Mark completed todo N as incomplete\n   - `list [N]` or no args - Show all (or N number of) todos in a user-friendly format, with each todo numbered for reference\n   - `past due` - Show all of the tasks which are past due and still active\n   - `next` - Shows the next active task in the list, this should respect Due dates, if there are any. If not, just show the first todo in the Active list\n\n## Todo Format:\nUse this markdown format in todos.md:\n```markdown\n# Project Todos\n\n## Active\n- [ ] Task description here | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified)\n- [ ] Another task \n\n## Completed  \n- [x] Finished task | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) \n- [x] Another completed task | Due: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) | Done: MM-DD-YYYY (conditionally include HH:MM AM/PM, if specified) \n```\n\n## Behavior:\n- Number todos when displaying (1, 2, 3...)\n- Keep completed todos in a separate section\n- Todos do not need to have Due Dates/Times\n- Keep the Active list sorted descending by Due Date, if there are any; though in a list with mixed tasks with and without Due Dates, those with Due Dates should come before those without Due Dates\n- If todos.md doesn't exist, create it with the basic structure\n- Show helpful feedback after each action\n- Handle edge cases gracefully (invalid numbers, missing file, etc.)\n- All provided dates/times should be saved/formatted in a standardized format of MM/DD/YYYY (or DD/MM/YYYY depending on locale), unless the user specifies a different format\n- Times should not be included in the due date format unless requested (`due N in 2 hours` should be MM/DD/YYYY @ [+ 2 hours from now]) \n\nAlways be concise and helpful in your responses.\n"
